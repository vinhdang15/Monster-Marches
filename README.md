# 🏰 Monster Marches

> A 2D modular tower defense game inspired by Kingdom Rush, built with Unity and designed for scalability and live data updates.
> The world of nature is under siege.

Dark monsters are marching from the edge of the forest, corrupting everything in their path — trees wither, crops die, and villages fall.  
As a defender of the land, you must lead the resistance: build towers, command brave soldiers, and hold the line at all costs.

**Monster Marches** is not just another tower defense game. It features flexible soldier control, live-updatable maps and enemies via GitHub, and a rich visual style handcrafted in Adobe Illustrator.

Can you stop the withering tide before nature falls completely?
